The "snipping_shortcuts"-file is the main file that imports a function from the "send_image_email"-file. 
This program creates a keyboard shortcut for saving a picture from the clipboard with a unique name every time by just pressing D+M+V.
It also creates a shortcut for emailing an image that's been saved from the clipboard by just pressing S+M.
To make the program run in the background every time you turn your computer on, save the files as .pyw and put them in the "startup" folder. That way, you can just press the
they keyboard shortcuts whenever you need to without opening the file inside an editor and running it manually. 
You can change the keyboard shortcuts as you would like them to be.
